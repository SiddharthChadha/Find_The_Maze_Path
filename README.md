# Robot In The Grid

This code takes a 2D maze and finds the coodinates of the path from start to end

Note: If a value at certain row,col in 2D maze is 0, that means the path is blocked and the algorithm looks for a different path. 

This code is developed using concepts such as Dynamic Programming, Depth First Graph search, Recursion and Memoization
